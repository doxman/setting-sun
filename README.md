# setting-sun
Basic React and Typescript implementation of the Setting Sun wooden slide puzzle

Inspired by the web adaptation of the puzzle here: https://smallpond.ca/jim/misc/settingSun/index.html

It's a clunky puzzle to do with a web interface, but a good way to demonstrate React/Typescript skills at a small scale

## Usage

Ensure you have `node`/`npm` and `yarn` installed (I used `node v14.17.x`, `npm v7.21.x`, `yarn 1.22.11`)

Clone the repo. Run `yarn install` in the root `setting-sun` directory, then `cd app` and `yarn start` to launch the webapp.

## Screenshots

Some screenshots, will be updated as I improve the UX
