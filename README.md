# setting-sun
Basic React and Typescript implementation of the Setting Sun wooden slide puzzle

Inspired by the web adaptation of the puzzle here: https://smallpond.ca/jim/misc/settingSun/index.html

It's a clunky puzzle to do with a web interface, but a good way to demonstrate React/Typescript skills at a small scale
